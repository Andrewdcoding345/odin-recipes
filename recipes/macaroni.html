<h3>Recipe Tips</h3> 

<p>Gluten-free penne pasta can be used in place of elbow pasta. Any variety of cheese can be used in place of Cheddar cheese, if desired.</p> 

<p>You can use your hands or a food processor to break the toast into crumbs for the topping.</p> 

<p>If you don't want a crunchy topping, sprinkle the reserved 1 cup of shredded Cheddar cheese on top of the pasta mixture and bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes.</p>
